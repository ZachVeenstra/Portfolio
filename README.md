# Zach Veenstra
* I love mountain biking. I have been riding since I was a kid and it's one of my favorite activities!
* Ultimate frisbee is another one of my favorite activities. I play for GVSU's club team, and it is a great time.
* My favorite platform to develop for is iOS!

## Techinical Background
I had in internship in the summer of 2023 at Alarm.com located in the D.C. metro area, and it was a great experience. I was an iOS Software Engineer intern, and I
gained experience in Swift, Objective-C, UIKit, and C#. Outside of that internship, I also have learned Python, Java, Javascript, and C. 
  
## Journal App project
For my term project in Systems Design and Analysis, we were tasked with 
creating a term project. For my team's project, we decided to create a journal app for iOS. The main idea is that the user will upload pictures they took throughout the day, and write a journal entry about them. From there, they can save that journal and optionally post it to their public profile. If they post it publicly, other users can see the journal and can comment on it.
Here is a link to the [project's GitHub repository](https://zachveenstra.github.io/TheTuringTrio/).
