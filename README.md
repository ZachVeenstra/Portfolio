* I love mountain biking. I have been riding since I was a kid and it's one of my favorite activities!
* Ultimate frisbee is another one of my favorite activities. I play for GVSU's club team, and it is a great time.
* My favorite platform to develop for is iOS!
## Techinical Background
I had in internship in the summer of 2023 at Alarm.com located in the D.C. metro area, and it was a great experience. I was an iOS Software Engineer intern, and I
gained experience in Swift, Objective-C, UIKit, and C#. Outside of that internship, I also have learned Python, Java, Javascript, and C.
